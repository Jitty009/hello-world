New Main Menu class & object
  Includes method to create new Character objects and adds them to ArrayLists
  Character constructor assigns sequential ID number and randomly generated Initiative number
    Two ArrayLists; one for ID numbers, one for Characters/their Random Initiative numbers
      Chars added to Random Initiative list as they're created. For loop runs through the list and sorts higher values toward the beginning. 
      Another for loop looks through Random Initiative list and sorts objects' ID numbers into separate list in order.
        This should work with existing code to create random turn order
